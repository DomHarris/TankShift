#Welcome to TankShift
This is hopefully a well-documented look at some sort of reasonably clean Unity game.touch 

To get started:
- Import the assets from https://kenney.nl/assets/abstract-platformer, you'll probably have to set up the Assets/Environment/RedGround sprite shape controller too
- Install LeanPool from the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/lean-pool-35666

#Credits
- Major thanks to Sebastian Lague, this project uses a heavily modified version of his character controller tutorial, which you can find here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFt_AvWsXl0f0hqURlhyIoAabKPgRsqjz
- This project also uses a slightly modified version of eriksk's Googly Eyes. It's a wonderful script, you should add it to every game you make: https://github.com/eriksk/googlyeyes
- The free version of DOTween has been used, read more about it here: http://dotween.demigiant.com/
