# Welcome to TankShift
This is hopefully a well-documented look at some sort of reasonably clean Unity game. The aim for this project is to provide a look at some general game architecture, and show off a bunch of the Unity/C# functionality that a lot of people don't know all that much about.

## To get started:
- Download the project
- Install LeanPool from the Unity Asset Store: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/lean-pool-35666

## How to use
Poke around. Break things. Try adding some extra functionality or doing some level design. **Break things**. Ask me questions - [Email me](mailto:dom@wayfarer-games.com) or shoot me a message on [Discord](https://discord.com/) - my username is _theChief and I'm usually happy to answer any questions you've got.

## Credits

- This project also uses a slightly modified version of eriksk's Googly Eyes. It's a wonderful script, you should add it to every game you make: https://github.com/eriksk/googlyeyes
